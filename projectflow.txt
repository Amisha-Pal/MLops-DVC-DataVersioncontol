1. Create git repo and clone it in local
2. Create mycode.py and add code to it (it will save a csv file to a new "data" folder)
3. Do a git add-commit-push initializing dvc.
# pip install dvc
4. Now we do "init dvc" (creates, .dvcignore, .dvc)
5. how do "mkdir S3" (creates a new directory)
6. how we do "dvc remote add -d myremote S3"
7. Next "dvc add data/"
    Now it will ask to do: ("git rm -r --cached data'" and git commit -m "stop tracking data"')
    Because initially we were tracking data/ folder from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle 
8. Again we do "dvc add data/" (creates data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc"
9. Now "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
10. Do a git add-commit-push to mark this stage as first version of data.
11. Now make changes to mycode.py to append a new row in data, check changes via "dvc status"
12. Again - - "dvc commit" and then "dev push"
13. Then git add-commit-push (we're saving v2 of our data at this point)
14. Check dvc/git status, everything should be upto date.
15. Now repeat step 10-12 for v3 of date
